For this project, you will primarily use a mortgage data set from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (https://www.consumerfinance.gov) collected and made public under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/). 
This data set contains information on all the mortgage loan applications made in the US and their outcomes. 
The data also contains information about the applicant.
